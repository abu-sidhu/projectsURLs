This is my First Python API.

A prediction model is created from the 150 observations of IRIS flowers to predict the speicies.
It's predicted by giving the Sepal lenght, Petal Lenght, Sepal Width & Petal Width of Iris and the trained model will predict the Speicies.

the full project is given it the corresponding section.
