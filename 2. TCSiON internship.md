For any company, finding talented employees and providing them good salary for their efforts and skills is an important aspect
since better provided employees with right skills are the backbone of the company. To predict the salary of an employee for the salary hike is always
a huge task for the HR team of the Company. A prediction is an assumption about a future event so the prediction is based upon knowledge, work flow,
experience and other factors.  In this project, salary of an employee of an organization is to be predicted on basis of 25 factors. 
For that, a supervised regression model is build for training the data by creating a salary dashboard to predict the increment of the employees. 

For that a dataset of company employees having 35 features and 1470 observations is selected from www.kaggle.com and after data cleaning, missing vlaue handling, outlier detection,
feature reduction and all, 25 relevent features are trained & tested with around 90% accuracy by random forest algorithm. and this model is hosted in 
pythonanywhere environment by using python flask as a REST API.

URL for hosted web REST API is given below
